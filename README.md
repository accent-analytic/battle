# Establishing Localized Safe Zones to Mitigate Against the Spread of a Pandemic
Applied Data Science Capstone

The global coronavirus pandemic of 2020 has caused widespread infection of people, along with many deaths. One strategy that appears to have been at least partially effective in combatting the spread of the virus has been to issue ‘stay at home’ orders. While these are effective, the toll on businesses and the people that own or work at them has been great. Businesses have been forced to close, resulting in record unemployment levels in the United States, along with the resulting effects on people’s incomes and their mental health.

On April 4, 2020, President Trump said in a press conference that it was imperative to get to a point where life can get back to normal. He highlighted restaurants, sports venues and other social gathering locations in particular as being desirable to reopen as soon as possible.

This study will look into the feasibility of establishing ‘safe zones’ – parts of the country that are - and can be kept - free of the virus. People who have tested negative for the virus could be moved from nearby hot zones into the safe zones, and in the event that someone in the safe zone test positive, they can be moved out of the safe zone.
